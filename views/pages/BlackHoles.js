      <h2>Facts about Black Holes</h2>
      <p>
        Black holes are among the strangest things in the universe. They are
        massive objects – collections of mass – with gravity so strong that
        nothing can escape, not even light. The most common types of black holes
        are the stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Stellar-mass black
        holes are created when massive stars explode, leaving behind a black
        hole with the mass of just a few suns. Supermassive black holes exist in
        the hearts of galaxies and usually contain the mass equivalent of
        millions of suns.

      <h2>Famous Black Holes</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Cygnus X-1:</strong> a stellar-mass black hole and x-ray source
        that lies some 6,500 light-years away. It is a binary system that
        contains a blue supergiant variable star and the x-ray source thought to
        be the black hole.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sagittarius A*:</strong> the supermassive black hole at the
        heart of the Milky Way Galaxy. It lies in the direction of the
        constellation Sagittarius. This black hole contains the mass of about 4
        million suns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>M87:</strong> this elliptical galaxy has a 3.5 billion
        solar-mass black hole at its heart. The black hole is surrounded by a
        disk of superheated material and has a jet of superheated material
        streaming away from the black hole that extends across 5,000 light-years
        from the galaxy’s core.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Centaurus A:</strong> this galaxy, which lies in the direction
        of the constellation Centaurus, is a giant spiral galaxy with an
        incredibly active nucleus. It contains a 55 million solar-mass black
        hole at its heart, with two jets of material that stream away from the
        galaxy at about half the speed of light across a million light-years of
        space.

      <h2>Facts about Black Holes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The massive gravitational influence of a black hole distorts space and
          time in the near neighbourhood. The closer you get to a black hole,
          the slower time runs. Material that gets too close to a black hole
          gets sucked in and can never escape.
        </li>
        <li>
          Material spirals in to a black hole through an accretion disk — a disk
          of gas, dust, stars and planets that fall into orbit the black hole.
        </li>
        <li>
          The “point of no return” around a black hole is called the “event
          horizon”. This is the region where the gravity of the black hole
          overcomes the momentum of material spinning around it in the accretion
          disk. Once something cross the event horizon, it is lost to the pull
          of the black hole.
        </li>
        <li>
          Black holes were first proposed to exist in the 18th century, but
          remained a mathematical curiosity until the first candidate black hole
          was found in 1964. It was called Cygnus X-1, an x-ray source in the
          constellation Cygnus.
        </li>
        <li>
          Black holes do not emit radiation on their own. They are detected by
          the radiation given off as material is heated in the accretion disk,
          and also by the black hole’s gravitational effect on other nearby
          objects (or light passing by).
