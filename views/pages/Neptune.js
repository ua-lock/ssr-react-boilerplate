      <h3>Facts about Neptune</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune is the most distant planet from the Sun.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune is the smallest gas giant. </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A year on Neptune lasts 165 Earth years.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea. </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune has 6 faint rings. </strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune was not known to the ancients.</strong>
          <br />
          It is not visible to the naked eye and was first observed in 1846. Its
          position was determined using mathematical predictions. It was named
          after the Roman god of the sea.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune spins on its axis very rapidly.</strong>
          <br />
          Its equatorial clouds take 16 hours to make one rotation. This is
          because Neptune is not solid body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune is the smallest of the ice giants.</strong>
          <br />
          Despite being smaller than Uranus, Neptune has a greater mass. Below
          its heavy atmosphere, Uranus is made of layers of hydrogen, helium,
          and methane gases. They enclose a layer of water, ammonia and methane
          ice. The inner core of the planet is made of rock.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            The atmosphere of Neptune is made of hydrogen and helium, with some
            methane.
          </strong>
          <br />
          The methane absorbs red light, which makes the planet appear a lovely
          blue. High, thin clouds drift in the upper atmosphere.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune has a very active climate.</strong>
          <br />
          Large storms whirl through its upper atmosphere, and high-speed winds
          track around the planet at up 600 meters per second. One of the
          largest storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. It was called the Great
          Dark Spot. It lasted about five years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune has a very thin collection of rings.</strong>
          <br />
          They are likely made up of ice particles mixed with dust grains and
          possibly coated with a carbon-based substance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neptune has 14 moons.</strong>
          <br />
          The most interesting moon is Triton, a frozen world that is spewing
          nitrogen ice and dust particles out from below its surface. It was
          likely captured by the gravitational pull of Neptune. It is probably
          the coldest world in the solar system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Only one spacecraft has flown by Neptune.</strong>
          <br />
          In 1989, the Voyager 2 spacecraft swept past the planet. It returned
          the first close-up images of the Neptune system. The NASA/ESA Hubble
          Space Telescope has also studied this planet, as have a number of
          ground-based telescopes.
