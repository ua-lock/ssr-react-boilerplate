      <h3>Facts about Saturn</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Saturn is the most distant planet that can be seen with the naked
            eye.
          </strong>
          <br />
          It is the fifth brightest object in the solar system and is also
          easily studied through binoculars or a small telescope.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Saturn was known to the ancients, including the Babylonians and Far
            Eastern observers.
          </strong>
          <br />
          It is named for the Roman god Saturnus, and was known to the Greeks as
          Cronus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saturn is the flattest planet.</strong>
          <br />
          Its polar diameter is 90% of its equatorial diameter, this is due to
          its low density and fast rotation. Saturn turns on its axis once every
          10 hours and 34 minutes&nbsp;giving it the second-shortest day of any
          of the solar system’s planets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saturn orbits the Sun once every 29.4 Earth years.</strong>
          <br />
          Its slow movement against the backdrop of stars earned it the nickname
          of “Lubadsagush” from the ancient Assyrians. The name means “oldest of
          the old”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Saturn’s upper atmosphere is divided into bands of clouds.
          </strong>
          <br />
          The top layers are mostly ammonia ice. Below them, the clouds are
          largely water ice. Below are layers of cold hydrogen and sulfur ice
          mixtures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saturn has oval-shaped storms similar to Jupiter’s.</strong>
          <br />
          The region around its north pole has a hexagonal-shaped pattern of
          clouds. Scientists think this may be a wave pattern in the upper
          clouds. The planet also has a vortex over its south pole that
          resembles a hurricane-like storm.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen.</strong>
          <br />
          It exists in layers that get denser farther into the planet.
          Eventually, deep inside, the hydrogen becomes metallic. At the core
          lies a hot interior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Saturn has the most extensive rings in the solar system.
          </strong>
          <br />
          The Saturnian rings are made mostly of chunks of ice and small amounts
          of carbonaceous dust. The rings stretch out more than 120,700 km from
          the planet, but are are amazingly thin: only about 20 meters thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saturn has 150 moons and smaller moonlets.</strong>
          <br />
          All are frozen worlds. The largest moons are Titan and Rhea. Enceladus
          appears to have an ocean below its frozen surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Titan is a moon with complex and dense nitrogen-rich atmosphere.
          </strong>
          <br />
          It is composed mostly of water ice and rock. Its frozen surface has
          lakes of liquid methane and landscapes covered with frozen nitrogen.
          Planetary scientists consider Titan to be a possible harbour for life,
          but not Earth-like life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Four spacecraft have visited Saturn.</strong>
          <br />
          <i>Pioneer 11</i>,&nbsp;<i>Voyager 1&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>2</i>, and
          the<i>&nbsp;Cassini-Huygens mission&nbsp;</i>have all studied the
          planet. Cassini orbited Saturn from July 2004 until September 2017,
          sending back a wealth of data about the planet, its moons, and rings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saturn has more moons than any other planet.</strong>
          <br /> 20 new moons were discovered in 2019 bring the total to 82, 3
          more than Jupiter.
